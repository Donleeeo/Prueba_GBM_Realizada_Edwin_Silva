3. You are standing on the OX-axis at point 0 and you want to move to an integer point x > 0.
You can make several jumps. Suppose you're currently at point y (y may be negative) and
jump for the k-th time.
a. You can:
i. either jump to the point y+k or
ii. jump to the point y−1.
What is the minimum number of jumps you need to reach the point x?
Input
The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤1000) — the number of test cases.
The first and only line of each test case contains the single integer x (1≤x≤106) — the
destination point.
Output
For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum number of jumps to reach x. It can
be proved that we can reach any integer point x.

Note:
In the first test case x = 1, so you ned only one jump: the 1-st jump from 0 to 0 + 1 = 1
In the second test case x = 2. You need at least three jumps:
The 1-st jump from 0 to 0 + 1 = 1
The 2-nd jump from 1 to 1 + 2 = 3
The 3-rd jump from 3 to 3 - 1 = 2
Two jumps are not enough because these are the only possible variants:
The 1-st jump as -1 and the 2-nd one as -1, you’ll reach 0 - 1 - 1 = -2
The 1-st jump as -1 and the 2-nd one as +2, you’ll reach 0 - 1 + 2 = 1
The 1-st jump as -1 and the 2-nd one as -1, you’ll reach 0 - 1 - 1 = 0
The 1-st jump as -1 and the 2-nd one as +2, you’ll reach 0 - 1 + 2 = 3
In the third test case, you need two jumps: the 1-st one as +1 and the 2-nd one as +2, so 0+1+2=3
In the fourth test case, you need three jumps: the 1-st one as -1, the 2nd one as +2 and the 3-rd one
as +3, so 0 - 1 + +2 +3 = 4
